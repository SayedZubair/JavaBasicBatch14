		// it helps maintain and modify the code easily
		// it helps us write more secure codes
		// simpilify the development of large programs
		// it helps us reduce duplicate code in our programs
		   // main pillars of oop
		// classes and objects
		// Inheritance 
		// polymorphism 
		// abstraction
		// encapsulation.
		
	// classes and objects
		// A class is template/ blueprint from which we create the objects
		// an object in programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.
	
		//Object;
		// objects  have states that define how the project looks like. we define the states with the help 
		// attributes / properties/ field 
		
		
		// what is an object. 
//		everything around us is an Object. for example ,,keyboard mouse light
//		object can be defined based on how they look and how they behave, objects in computer programming
//		are also similar. they have state(which helps us define how that object looks lie ) and behaviour
//      (what that object does)
		// what is a class
		//class is blueprint/design/template from which we create objects.
		
		
		//object oriented programming;
		// it just a way of writing programs.
		// this is most popular one,
		// why we should learn or oop;
		// 1, it will simplify the development of large programs
		// 2. it will also help us maintain and modify the exisitng code.
		// 3. it helps us use write more secure code
		// 4. helps us avoid duplicate code.
		// 5. what is the syntax
